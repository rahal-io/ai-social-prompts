Your task is to build out, improve and generate new content ideas based on my previous idea input. Follow these steps. Do each step, even if you think you do not need to.
First generate a list of 30 ideas (short title only)
Second, go through the list and determine whether the ideas are different and bold, modify the ideas as needed to make them bolder and more different. No two ideas should be the same. This is important!
Next, give the ideas a name and combine it with a product description. The name and idea are separated by a colon and followed by a description. The idea should be expressed as a paragraph of 40-80 words. Do this step by step!
