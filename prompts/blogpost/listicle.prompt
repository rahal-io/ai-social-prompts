Your task is to write a Listicle Post. Follow this template slowly, step-by-step:
1. Write an introduction contextualizing your list
2. Number the list and format each subhead as an H2 Tag
3. Use parallel structure for list items and emphasize keywords
4. Explain the order if and when necessary
5. Address your reader like a real human
6. Conclude with an invitation to engage, not a summary
