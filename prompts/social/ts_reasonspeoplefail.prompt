I have been doing X for a long time.
Over the years, I have learned that most people who want to achieve X end up failing because {{why}}. They think {{myth}}, and never realize Y is what's actually holding them back. To be honest, it took me quite a while to learn this lesson too.
Here are some of the other reasons I've learned people fail at X:
Reason #1: People fail because why?
Reason #2: People fail because why?
Reason #3: People fail because why?
Overcoming failure is a crucial part of succeeding, moving forward, and making actionable progress.
But don't worry: we've all been there.
