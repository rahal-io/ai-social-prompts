{{a}}When I was (age), I (experienced something).]
{{b}} In this next section, explain what happened. Where were you? Who were you with? What happened, and why did it matter so much to you at the time? Who else saw? What did you feel? What did you think was going to happen, and what happened instead?]
{{b}} In one single bolded sentence, share the feeling you felt.]
{{d}} Now, expand on that feeling. Develop it. How did the experience play out in the rest of your life? Did you carry it with you for a long time? How did it impact other things—like say, making friends, forming relationships, trusting other people, or your ability to pursue your dreams? Did you think about it often? What was the image, or the phrase, or the specific moment that came up for you time and time again? How did your interpretation of the event change as time went on?]
{{d}} When did things start to change? What caused the change? How did you start growing in a different direction? What was the moment? Similar to {{b}}, what happened? Where were you? Who were you with? What happened, and why did it matter so much to you at that time? Who else saw? What did you feel? What did you think was going to happen, and what happened instead?]
{{c}} In one single bolded sentence, share the final moment of change.]
{{c}} When was "the transformation complete?" What did you and your life look like before, and what did you and your life look like after?]
{{e}} Finally, explain to the reader why this story matters. Why did you want to share it? What's the final morale you want the reader to be left with? What should the reader walk away thinking about differently? How can they learn from your story and apply those learnings to their own life?]
{{e}} If you could summarize this story in one single sentence for the reader to end with, what would it be?]
