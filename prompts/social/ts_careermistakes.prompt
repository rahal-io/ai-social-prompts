{X} Profound Career Mistakes Everyone (From Intern To Executive) Should Avoid In Their Career
A few {{time}} ago, I asked {{x}} {{niche}} leaders one simple question:
“What early career mistake will you never make again?”
What I ended up walking away with was a messy notepad full of notes, a completely new way of seeing the world, and {{x}} profound mistakes everyone (from intern to executive) should avoid in their career.
Let’s dive in:
Mistake #1: {{mistake1}}
Too often, {{role}} choose to {{wrongdecision}}.
They {{whydecision}}. They think {{logic}}. Only to end up {{badoutcome}}.
Instead, {{role}} should be focused on {{rightdecision}}.
This is what ends up leading to {{positiveoutcome}}, {{positiveoutcome}}, and {{positiveoutcome}}.
Mistake #2: {{mistake2}}
A good {{role}} can {{goodoutcome}}.
A bad {{role}} can {{badoutcome}}.
But a legendary {{role}} can {{giantoutcome}}.
Don’t get it confused: a {{goodoutcome}} is good, but it’s far from what makes the most difference.
Mistake #3: {{mistake3}}
Until you’ve {{milestone}}, don’t take your eye off the ball.
{{relevantquote}}.
To this day, I hang this quote up on my wall because it reminds me {{takeaway}}.
Mistake #4: {{mistake4}}
Traditional wisdom says {{traditionalwisdom}}.
But that’s only true if you don’t do two things correctly:
{{rightdecision1}}
{{rightdecision2}}
Then, {{traditionalwisdom}} works great.
Mistake #5: {{mistake5}}
We all think we can {{decision}}.
We all think we have unlimited {{resource}}.
We all think we are immune to {{disaster}}.
But the truth is, we’re not.
Which is why it’s much better to operate from first principles, and {{rightdecision}} from the very beginning.
