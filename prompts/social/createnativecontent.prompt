Create a native template for a social media post that aligns with {{insert_brand_or_campaign_name}}. The post should be engaging and visually appealing, tailored to the platform (e.g., Instagram, Twitter, Facebook). The design should reflect {{insert_tone_e_g_professional_fun_educational}} and include {{insert_key_elements_like_logo_brand_colors_or_specific_imagery}}. The template should be flexible enough to accommodate text, images, and calls to action while maintaining consistency with the brand's identity.
