{X} Controversial Opinions On {Topic} 99% Of The World Agrees With—But I Do Not
I have been interested in {{topic}} for a long time.
And over the past {{numberofyears}}, I have come across a lot of strong opinions about {{topic}} that, at first I agreed with, and then the more I learned and educated myself the more I disagreed with. Until eventually, I reached a point where I felt like the only reason these beliefs had become mainstream and commonly accepted was because “a lot of other people” agreed with them too.
So, I have some controversial opinions I’d like to share on {{topic}} after {{x}} hours immersing myself in the subject:
{{strongopinion1}}
I’m not saying {{subtledistinction}}.
I’m just saying {{clarifyingstatement}}.
{{strongopinion2}}
Contrary to popular belief, {{clicheaction}} is a myth.
{{failureexample1}}
{{failureexample2}}
{{failureexample3}}
{{clicheaction}} is a fast-track to {{undesirableoutcome}}.
{{strongopinion3}}
“Most people” do what “most people” do.
Which leads to…
{{negativestat1}}
{{negativestat2}}
{{negativestat3}}
Clearly what “most people do” doesn’t work.
So do something else.
{{strongopinion4}}
99% of the time, this is a giant mistake.
Instead, {{name}} has a great framework for achieving {{outcome}} without falling into {{trap}}.
{{step1}}
{{step2}}
{{step3}}
{{strongopinion5}}
Pursuing {{outcome}} is a silly goal.
Because {{unconventionalreason}}.
{{differentoutcome}} is a better pursuit in life.
{{benefit1}}
{{benefit2}}
{{benefit3}}
