TS_careerMistakes,"{X} Profound Career Mistakes Everyone (From Intern To Executive) Should Avoid In Their Career
A few [Time] ago, I asked [X] [Niche] leaders one simple question:
“What early career mistake will you never make again?”
What I ended up walking away with was a messy notepad full of notes, a completely new way of seeing the world, and [X] profound mistakes everyone (from intern to executive) should avoid in their career.
Let’s dive in:
Mistake #1: [Mistake1]
Too often, [Role] choose to [WrongDecision].
They [WhyDecision]. They think [Logic]. Only to end up [BadOutcome].
Instead, [Role] should be focused on [RightDecision].
This is what ends up leading to [PositiveOutcome], [PositiveOutcome], and [PositiveOutcome].
Mistake #2: [Mistake2]
A good [Role] can [GoodOutcome].
A bad [Role] can [BadOutcome].
But a legendary [Role] can [GiantOutcome].
Don’t get it confused: a [GoodOutcome] is good, but it’s far from what makes the most difference.
Mistake #3: [Mistake3]
Until you’ve [Milestone], don’t take your eye off the ball.
[”RelevantQuote”].
To this day, I hang this quote up on my wall because it reminds me [Takeaway].
Mistake #4: [Mistake4]
Traditional wisdom says [TraditionalWisdom].
But that’s only true if you don’t do two things correctly:
[RightDecision1]
[RightDecision2]
Then, [TraditionalWisdom] works great.
Mistake #5: [Mistake5]
We all think we can [Decision].
We all think we have unlimited [Resource].
We all think we are immune to [Disaster].
But the truth is, we’re not.
Which is why it’s much better to operate from first principles, and [RightDecision] from the very beginning.","##{X} Profound Career Mistakes Everyone (From Intern To Executive) Should Avoid In Their Career
